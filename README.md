# Weather-Dashboard
## Task :man_technologist:
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a Weather Dashboard application that changes dynamically. The application uses jQuery to make an AJAX call to the Open Weather Map API to retrieve information such as City coordinates, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and even icons representing current weather condtions. The information from that call is then appended to the HTML with jQery.

Once a search has been made the user's recent searches populate in a <div> section underneathe the search bar.

## Thoughts and Notes :thinking:
This assignment was challenging at first glance but after some psuedo-coding and application of prior knowledge, it became easier to deal with. My code isn't perfect though, there is likely a cleaner way to display the information from the API. Still, I'm proud of the this turned out.
